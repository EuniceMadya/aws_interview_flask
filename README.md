# aws_interview_flask
This is the project for the aws interview, you may upload & download using S3, or take a snapshot of EC2 instance.
This would not be able to run correctly on your laptop due to the lack of access keys that's stored on EC2 as well as on my local laptop as environment variables.
The framework used is Flask.
