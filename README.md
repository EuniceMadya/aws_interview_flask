# aws_interview_flask
This is the project for the aws interview, you may upload & download using S3, or take a snapshot of EC2 instance.
This would not be able to run correctly on your laptop due to the lack of access keys that's stored on EC2 as well as on my local laptop as environment variables.

## The framework used is Flask.

To run the website locally, you need to:
1. Run the python file "flask_pr.py" in terminal, the command line would be "python3 flask_pr.py" for MAC OS and Linux system.
2. Open the browser and put in "http://0.0.0.0:5000/" to access the homepage
3. Follow the instruction in the screenshot document. Please check "screenshot instruction.docx".
4. A simple demo video is also included. The filename is "simple demo.mp4".
